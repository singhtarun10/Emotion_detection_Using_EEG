# Emotion_detection_Using_EEG
 emotion detection system using EEG (Electroencephalography) signals. a hybrid ng an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, followed by a CNN-BiLSTM model for emotion classification. The autoencoder compresses high-dimensional EEG data, while the CNN-BiLSTM leverages both spatial (CNN) and temporal (LSTM) characteristics t
